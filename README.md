# My idea for new cricket match format "BOT (Best-Of-Three) Challenge"

Here is my idea for the new cricket match format , say "Best Of Three" (BOT) challenge

# In Summary:
This is nothing but, three T10 matches where Team A and B bat/bowl one after another alternatively.
I am suggesting this match format, as it can be more interesting than current booooo...ring 50 over ODI.

# Details:
"BOT Challenge" Match is divided into 3 laps (10-over innings in each lap)

lap1: Team A bat first and sets a target, Team B chases that target ==> (result 1)
lap2: Team B continues to bat for another 10 overs and gives a target, then team A chases that target for another 10 overs ==> (result 2)
lap3: Team A continues to bat for another 10 overs and gives the final target, team B chases that ==> (result 3)

- we'll have 3 results from 3 laps
- winner will be decided on the Best-of-Three rule (must win 2 out of 3 laps)
- A team will be obvious winner if manage to win lap 1 and 2, no need to play lap 3
- if couldn't decide winner from the Best-of-Three rule (in case of tie), final result will decide the winner

# Example of "BOT Challenge" cricket match format 
NOTE: / = battingüèè   . = bowling‚öæ

Lap:    1				 		   	                           2                          							   3  
Team A: / / / / / / / / / / . . . . . . . . . .    . . . . . . . . . . / / / / / / / / / /   / / / / / / / / / / . . . . . . . . . .  
Team B: . . . . . . . . . . / / / / / / / / / /   / / / / / / / / / / . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . . . . . . . / / / / / / / / / /  
result: -------------------------------- A wins   -------------------------------- B wins   ----------------------------------- A wins  

Winner: Team A, as it wins lap 1 and 3

## rules (can be modified or add more):
- in each lap one player can bowl max 3 overs, in total max 7 overs
- lap-1 is power play
