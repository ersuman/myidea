# My idea for New/Enhanced ODI Cricket match format
Current ODI format is of 50 overs innings, I find this format too much boooooring... That's why I am suggesting this **NEW** ODI format.  
**Rules:**  
* Match will be of 40 overs for each team
* Team-A and Team-B will play(bat/bowl) alternatively 10-10 overs.
   
This format would enhance the excitement for both teams compared to the traditional 50-over format. In the current format, if the batting team plays for 50 overs, the chasing team's fans may not experience as much engagement.
Additionally, this new format has the potential to conclude earlier if one team significantly outperforms the other, leading to a more decisive result.

# New cricket match format "BOT (Best-Of-Three) Challenge"

Here is my idea for the new cricket match format , say "Best Of Three" (BOT) challenge

## In Summary:
This is nothing but, three T10 matches where Team A and B bat/bowl one after another alternatively.
I am suggesting this match format, as it can be more interesting than current boooooring 50 over ODI.

## Details:
|   Set   | 1          |            | 2          |            | 3          |            |
|---------|:-----------|------------|:-----------|------------|:-----------|------------|
| Innings | 1          | 2          | 1          | 2          | 1          | 2          |
| Team A  | 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏 | ⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾ | ⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾ | 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏 | 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏 | ⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾ |
| Team B  | ⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾ | 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏 | 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏 | ⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾ | ⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾⚾ | 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏 |

"BOT Challenge" Match is divided into 3 Sets (10-over innings in each set)

**Set-1:** Team A bat first and sets a target, Team B chases that target ==> (result 1)  

**Set-2:** Team B continues to bat for another 10 overs and gives a target, then team A chases that target for another 10 overs ==> (result 2)  

**Set-3:** Team A continues to bat for another 10 overs and gives the final target, team B chases that ==> (result 3)  

- we'll have 3 results from 3 sets
- winner will be decided on the Best-of-Three rule (must win 2 out of 3 sets, or 1 win if 2 sets draw)
- A team will be obvious winner if manage to win set 1 and 2, then no need to play set-3
- If couldn't decide winner from Best-of-Three rule (in case of tie), then total score will decide the winner 

## Example of "BOT Challenge" cricket match format 
NOTE: / = batting🏏     . = bowling⚾
```
Set:    1                                         2                                         3
Team A: / / / / / / / / / / . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . . . . . . . / / / / / / / / / /   / / / / / / / / / / . . . . . . . . . .
Team B: . . . . . . . . . . / / / / / / / / / /   / / / / / / / / / / . . . . . . . . . .   . . . . . . . . . . / / / / / / / / / /
result: --------------------------> Team A wins   --------------------------> Team B wins   ---------------------------> Team A wins  
```
Winner: Team A, as it wins set 1 and 3
If two set results in draw, then another set winner will be final winner
e.g. set1 = drwa, set2 = team B wins, set3 = draw : then Team B will be winner

## rules (can be modified or add more):
- in each set one player can bowl max 3 overs, in total max 7 overs
- Set-1 is power play (with 3 players outside the 30 yard circle)
- point system:
  * 2 for win, 0 for loss
  * 3 points for winner, if manage to win in set-1
  * 1 point for losing team if couldn't decide winner from Best-of-three rule (in case of tie), then total score will decide the winner

### another thought:
**after a set is over, the team with least wickets available will bat first in another set**
